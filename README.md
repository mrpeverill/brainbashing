# Purpose

This repository is for all my miscellaneous MRI scripts. Mostly these were produced starting in about 2014 in the Sheridan labaratory and the Stress and Development labaratory. I keep a development and production branch - use anything not in production with caution (actually use everything with caution - never run a script you don't understand!).

These are almost all quality of life scripts to make it easier to work with various other programs or translate things between them. They are sorted according to the program they are designed to work with.

They are sorted roughly by which software package they're meant to go with.
