#Freesurfer's recon-all command is powerful, but needs a lot of knowledge to run correctly. Often, it needs to be run by many people who don't know a lot about the command line or Freesurfer. This script sets up project-specific config files that remain static throughout a project's lifetime, provides an easy front-end for end-users to run recon-all, and allows recon-all to be run in a batch format with support for grid-processing.
#The original batch-reconall had each project's setup hard-coded in the script. This created risk of settings being thoughtlessly (mis)applied to new projects, so the new version relies on the existence of configuration files in each project.
